/**
 * Structured metadata attached to thrown errors so telemetry can categorize
 * failures without parsing error messages. Producers tag errors via `tagError`;
 * consumers read merged meta from the error chain via `getErrorMeta`.
 *
 * Why a Symbol key: it never collides with caller-defined error fields and
 * doesn't show up in `Object.keys` or `JSON.stringify`, so attaching meta is
 * invisible to downstream code that doesn't know about it.
 *
 * Why mutate instead of wrapping: re-throwing the original error preserves
 * the stack trace and instance identity. A subclass tree would drown the
 * useful debugging info in synthetic frames. Wrapping is reserved for the
 * cases where we want to add context to the message itself (e.g. figma.ts
 * annotates the endpoint), and those wrappers chain via `cause` so the
 * original meta is still discoverable.
