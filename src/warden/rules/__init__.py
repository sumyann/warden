"""The rule registry.

Built-in rules are an explicit list (below) so behavior never depends on
import order or filesystem globbing. Third-party rules can additionally
register themselves via the `warden.rules` entry-point group in their own
package's pyproject.toml:

    [project.entry-points."warden.rules"]
    my_rule = "my_package.rules:RULE"

where `my_package.rules.RULE` is a `warden.rules.base.Rule` instance. See
docs/rule-authoring.md.
