Used to key suppressions (a user's "this is a false positive, stop showing it
to me" decision) across repeated scans of the same server. Pulled out as its
own tiny module — no other engine code depends on it — so that anything
consuming Warden as a library (e.g. a hosted UI with persisted suppressions)
can import the exact same hash function the engine itself uses internally,
with zero risk of the two drifting apart.
