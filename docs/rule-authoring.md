# Writing a Rule

## Built-in rules

Built-ins live in `src/warden/rules/w0NN_*.py` and are registered explicitly
in `src/warden/rules/__init__.py`'s `BUILTIN_RULES` list. We don't discover
built-ins by filesystem globbing -- an explicit list means scan behavior
never silently changes because a new file appeared on disk.

## Third-party plugin rules

You don't need to fork Warden to add a rule. Publish your own package with
an entry-point in the `warden.rules` group:

```toml
# your_package/pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."warden.rules"]
my_rule = "your_package.rules:RULE"
```

```python
# your_package/rules.py
from warden.rules.base import Rule, ParsedServer
from warden.models import Finding

def _check(parsed: ParsedServer):
    for f in parsed.files:
        if "TODO(security)" in f["content"]:
            yield Finding(
                rule_id="CUSTOM001",
                title="Unresolved security TODO",
                severity="LOW",
                file_path=f["path"],
                message="File has an unresolved TODO(security) marker.",
                remediation="Resolve or triage the marked TODO before shipping.",
            )

RULE = Rule(
    id="CUSTOM001",
    title="Unresolved Security TODO",
    severity="LOW",
    description="Flags TODO(security) markers left in source.",
    _check=_check,
)
```

Anyone with your package installed alongside `warden-mcp` gets your rule
picked up automatically by `warden.rules.all_rules()` (the CLI uses this,
not the `BUILTIN_RULES`-only list). A broken plugin rule can never crash a
scan -- `all_rules()` swallows exceptions raised while loading a plugin, and
`engine.run_scan()` swallows exceptions raised while a rule's `.check()` is
running, converting either into a single `INFO`-severity `{rule_id}-ERR`
finding instead.

## What we expect from a rule PR to this repo

If you're proposing a new **built-in** rule (not a plugin):

- **At least one true-positive and one true-negative fixture**, as a test in
  `tests/test_rules_fixtures.py` or a new `tests/test_wNNN_*.py`. A rule that
  can't demonstrate it doesn't fire on ordinary code will be asked to add
  more negative fixtures before merge.
- **A confidence score**, not just a severity. If your signal is
  context-dependent (only meaningful inside an MCP tool file, only
  meaningful alongside a write/exec op, etc.), gate it the way W002/W006/W007
  do -- see [architecture.md](./architecture.md#context-gating).
- **A benchmark check.** Run `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py` before and
  after your change. If your rule turns any of the 8 pinned fixtures' false
  positives from 0 to nonzero, either tighten the rule or correct
  `benchmark/labels.yaml` with justification in the PR description.
- **We reject noisy rules.** A rule that fires on ordinary, non-risky code
  more than rarely will not be merged as a built-in, no matter how
  theoretically interesting the risk it's chasing is. Precision is the
  product's core credibility claim (see the top-level README's benchmark
  section) -- a noisy built-in erodes that for every user, not just yours.
  If your detector is inherently high-recall/low-precision, it's a great
  candidate for a plugin instead.
- A `doc_link` pointing at a `docs/rules.md#your-anchor` section you've
  added, describing what the rule catches and why.
